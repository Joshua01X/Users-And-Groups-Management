## Introduction and Objectives
This project involved using Microsoft Entra ID to create and manage groups and users within a simulated cybersecurity organization. The objective was to demonstrate the ability to organize users into various groups, assign roles to these groups, and manually assign roles to specific users. Additionally, the project included assigning roles at the subscription level to manage access and permissions more effectively. This work aimed to showcase the application of role-based access control (RBAC) principles and illustrate the process of setting up a structured identity and access management system.

## Technologies Employed
- <b>Microsoft Entra ID</b>: Platform used for identity management and role-based access control.
- <b>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</b>: Framework used for assigning roles and permissions to users and groups.
- <b>Subscription Level Role Assignment</b>: Used to manage access and permissions at the subscription level.

## Methodologies/Execution of Process
<b>Group Creation</b>: Established various groups to emulate a simple cybersecurity organization structure, such as IT Admins, Security Analysts, and Support Staff.

## Insights and Implications
This project highlighted the practical application of Microsoft Entra ID for managing user roles and permissions in an organizational context. It emphasized the importance of structured role assignment to maintain security and operational efficiency. By incorporating subscription-level role assignments, the project demonstrated how to manage access and permissions across a broader scope, ensuring that users have the appropriate access needed for their roles. Additionally, it illustrated how role-based access control can enforce the principle of least privilege, supporting a secure and organized access control system.

## Conclusion
The project effectively showcased Microsoft Entra IDâ€™s capabilities in organizing users and managing roles at both the group and subscription levels. By creating and managing groups, assigning roles, and setting subscription-level permissions, it demonstrated how a structured approach to identity and access management can enhance security and operational effectiveness within an organization. This experience provided valuable insights into implementing RBAC principles and managing access in a comprehensive manner.
